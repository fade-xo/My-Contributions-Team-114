# My-Contributions-Team-114
The links to all contributions I made in the project phase as a product designer in the Zuri training on team 114.
I worked on the style guide that was used through out the project.
I also worked on the error 503 page web and mobile view.
Before the UI process began, I worked on the brainstorming part of the UX process.
I also worked on the User research and interviews.
